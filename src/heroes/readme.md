## process of OpenSourceHeroes projects

idea: 
* I wrote that "10000+ people have contributed to these projects, which have received 10000+ stars". I am confident that these number is more than the truth, but how do I get the numbers? The star part is easy, which has been done by src/counting.py and was shown in the bottom of each page as a page summary. But I don't know how to get the "10000+" people yet.
* My idea is that, instead of the projects listed in my list, we can focus on a broad range. Simply by searching "nCoV" or "COVID" on github, one can get hundreds of projects. as shown by the two json file in this folder (which is generated by searching.py).
* Meanwhile, I notice that, the owner cannot fully represent the contributors. We can include all forks as well, or pull request and issue contributions.
