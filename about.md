### [what is open source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
The term [open source](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software) refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it—and maintains exclusive control over it—can modify. People call this kind of software "proprietary" or "closed source" software.
